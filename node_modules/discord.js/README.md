[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hydrabolt/discord.js.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/hydrabolt/discord.js) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/discordjs/badge/?version=latest)](http://discordjs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/?badge=latest)
    

discord.js is a node module used as a way of interfacing with
[Discord](https://discordapp.com/). It is a very useful module for creating
bots.

**The examples in the repo are in ES6, either update your node or compile them down to babel yourself if you want to use them!**

### Installation
`npm install --save discord.js`

---

### Example
```js
var Discord = require("discord.js");

var mybot = new Discord.Client();

mybot.on("message", function(message){
	
	if(message.content === "ping")
		mybot.reply(message, "pong");
	
});

mybot.login("email", "password");
```

### What's new in 3.9.0?

Amongst some fixes to web distribution creation, you can now opt for easier string formatting! However, it does modify String globally so you'll have to run:

```js
Discord.patchStrings()
```

After you have run this, you can do:
```

"message".bold.underline.italic
// generates "*__**message**__*"

```

A full list of modifiers (all chainable):

* bold `**`
* italic `*`
* underline `__`
* strike `~`
* code `` ` ``
* codeblock ```` ``` ````
